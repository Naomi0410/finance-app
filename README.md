## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all of the personal finance app data at-a-glance on the overview page
- View all transactions on the transactions page with pagination for every ten transactions
- Search, sort, and filter transactions
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) budgets and saving pots
- View the latest three transactions for each budget category created
- View progress towards each pot
- Add money to and withdraw money from pots
- View recurring bills and the status of each for the current month
- Search and sort recurring bills
- Receive validation messages if required form fields aren't completed
- Navigate the whole app and perform all actions using only their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

Semantic HTML5

CSS custom properties

Tailwind CSS

React

Next.js (App Router)

MongoDB & Prisma

TypeScript

Vercel (deployment)



### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

Next.js App Router and server/client component boundaries

Optimizing performance with router.refresh() and dynamic() imports

Managing complex UI state with modals and dropdowns

Building accessible, keyboard-navigable interfaces

Structuring a full-stack app with authentication and database persistence

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```ts
router.refresh();
```


### Continued development

In future iterations, I’d like to:

Add dark mode support

Implement recurring transaction automation

Add charts for visualizing spending trends

Improve offline support with service workers
